            <h2>Understanding the CVE-2021-30481 Vulnerability</h2>
            <img src="./images/CVE.png" alt="CVE-2021-30481 Vulnerability" class="img-fluid mb-4">
            <p>CVE-2021-30481 is a significant security flaw within Steam’s Source engine, exploited through malicious game invitations to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the handling of command-line parameters during the game’s startup. By manipulating these parameters, attackers can establish a remote console (RCON) connection and execute harmful payloads on the victim’s system.</p>
            <p>In my attempts to replicate this vulnerability, I initially did not succeed. To gain a better understanding and find a way to reproduce it, I contacted Florian, the reporter of this CVE. He provided valuable assistance and suggested specific approaches to replicate the exploit.</p>
            <p>Following his suggestions, I was able to gain deeper insights and discovered a new vulnerability, which is described later on this page. This new issue allows an attacker to crash a player's game when they connect to a malicious RCON server.</p>
            <h3>Valve's Countermeasures:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Removing Vulnerable RCON Command Handlers: Valve eliminated the problematic handlers, thereby blocking the exploit’s core mechanism.</li>
                <li>Using GetLaunchCommandLine: Transitioning to this safer alternative for handling startup parameters has reduced the risk of injection attacks.</li>
                <li>User Warnings: For games still reliant on OS command lines, Valve now displays startup parameters, allowing users to spot and reject suspicious commands.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Wallhack Cheats: An Unseen Advantage</h2>
            <img src="./images/wallhack.png" alt="Wallhack Cheats" class="img-fluid mb-4">
            <p>Wallhacks are among the most notorious cheats in Counter-Strike 2, enabling players to see through walls and other obstacles, thus gaining an unfair advantage. My study involved both theoretical analysis and practical implementation of wallhacks to understand their workings and develop effective detection methods.</p>
            <h3>Implementation of Wallhacks</h3>
            <p>Wallhacks exploit various vulnerabilities in the game engine. They range from relatively simple methods like client-side manipulation—editing game files to make objects transparent—to more advanced techniques like memory manipulation. These advanced techniques involve directly altering the game’s memory to reveal player locations or manipulate in-game visualization processes, allowing players behind walls to be visible.</p>
            <h3>Survey Insights:</h3>
            <img src="./images/survey.png" alt="Survey Insights" class="img-fluid mb-4">
            <ul>
                <li>Prevalence: Players frequently encounter wallhackers, with estimates varying widely across different matches.</li>
                <li>Detection: Common signs include unnatural behavior such as shooting through walls and suspiciously accurate pre-aiming.</li>
                <li>Community Impact: Wallhacks significantly deteriorate the gaming experience, leading to frustration and increased toxicity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Proposed Solutions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhanced Anti-Cheat Systems: Implementing more robust systems akin to those used by Faceit or Valorant.</li>
                <li>Community Involvement: Reviving community-driven initiatives like Overwatch to empower players in identifying and reporting cheaters.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Detection of Wallhacks</h3>
            <p>Detecting wallhacks is complex and requires a layered approach. Systems like Valve’s Anti-Cheat (VAC) use methods such as file integrity checks, memory inspection, and heuristic analysis to identify cheats. These are supplemented by more advanced techniques like kernel-level monitoring, as employed by platforms like FACEIT and games like Valorant. These systems operate at the kernel level of the operating system, making them particularly effective in detecting unauthorized manipulations and monitoring suspicious system processes. However, kernel-level anti-cheat systems also raise significant privacy and security concerns. Due to their deep access to system resources, there are worries about the potential collection of personal data and the impact on system stability. This highlights the importance of transparency and strict regulations to protect user privacy while maintaining game integrity.</p>

            <h2>Reverse Engineering Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC)</h2>
            <img src="./images/reverse.png" alt="Reverse Engineering Valve Anti-Cheat" class="img-fluid mb-4">
            <p>My reverse engineering of VAC provides critical insights into its operations and vulnerabilities. VAC employs various modules and techniques, such as monitoring system information and process handles, to detect cheats. However, it faces challenges from sophisticated methods like timing attacks and code injection.</p>
            <h3>Reverse Engineering Process:</h3>
            <p>The reverse engineering of Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) involved several meticulous steps to understand its inner workings and identify vulnerabilities. Here is an in-depth look at the process:</p>
            <h4>1. Setting Up the Environment</h4>
            <p>To start, I set up a controlled environment using virtual machines to safely analyze VAC without risking my main system. This involved installing Steam and VAC-protected games on a virtual machine.</p>
            <h4>2. Using IDA Free for Decompilation</h4>
            <p>IDA Free, a powerful disassembler, was used to convert the binary code of VAC’s DLL files into a more readable assembly code. This step is crucial to understand the structure and functionality of VAC.</p>
            <h4>3. Analyzing the Assembly Code</h4>
            <p>By examining the assembly code, I identified key functions and routines used by VAC. This included functions responsible for system monitoring, memory inspection, and cheat detection.</p>
            <h4>4. Identifying Key Modules</h4>
            <p>Several modules within VAC were identified and analyzed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SystemInfo:</strong> Collects basic system information such as processor architecture and OS version.</li>
                <li><strong>ProcessHandleList:</strong> Inventories all running processes and their handles to detect unauthorized programs.</li>
                <li><strong>VacProcessMonitor:</strong> Monitors file mappings created by the Steam service for suspicious activity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>5. Hook Detection Techniques</h4>
            <p>VAC employs techniques to detect hooks in WinAPI functions like <code>NtReadVirtualMemory</code> and <code>NtQuerySystemInformation</code>. By comparing the initial bytes of these functions to expected values, VAC can identify unauthorized modifications.</p>
            <h4>6. Encryption and Hashing</h4>
            <p>VAC uses various encryption and hashing techniques such as MD5, ICE, CRC32, and XOR to protect the integrity of its data and make analysis more difficult for cheaters.</p>
            <h3>Improvement Strategies:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat: Implementing deeper-level monitoring, despite concerns over privacy and system stability.</li>
                <li>Client-Side Sandboxing: Isolating the game environment to prevent external manipulations.</li>

            <h2>Discovering a New Vulnerability</h2>
            <video src="./images/discovery.mp4" controls class="img-fluid mb-4"></video>
            <p>During my research, I attempted to replicate the payload and discovered a new issue. Using my custom-made Python script, I was able to crash a player’s game when they connected to my server via RCON.</p>
            <p>To achieve this, I wrote a Python script and utilized parts of the payload provided by Florian, the person who reported this CVE. This script acts as a malicious RCON server that, once a connection is established, sends a harmful payload to the client. The original intention was to exploit the CVE to open the calculator via Remote Code Execution (RCE). However, with the same payload, the user’s game now crashes. I am unsure why this happens and will investigate it further in the future.</p>
            <h3>How the Python Script Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Server Initialization:</strong> The script starts a TCP server that listens on a specific IP address and port number, set in the script’s configuration.</li>
                <li><strong>Receiving RCON Commands:</strong> The server waits for RCON commands from the client. Since the CS2 engine and RCON work in a way that the actual connection is only established when a command is received, the payload is only sent after the user sends an RCON command.</li>
                <li><strong>Sending the Malicious Payload:</strong> Upon receiving a command, the server sends a specially crafted payload. This payload was originally meant to open the calculator on the client machine via Remote Code Execution. However, it now causes the game to crash.</li>
                <li><strong>Logging and Debugging:</strong> The script includes extensive logging to follow each step of the process, from accepting connections to sending the payload and executing the exploit.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Testing on the Latest Version of CS2</h3>
            <p>I first tested this script on the latest version of Counter-Strike 2. To my surprise, this payload causes the newest version of the game to crash. This shows that the exploit can still affect the latest game versions, although it does not achieve the desired Remote Code Execution.</p>
            <p>I am currently in the process of writing a detailed report on this discovery so that I can submit it to HackerOne for further analysis and possible remediation by the developers.</p>
