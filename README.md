Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This repository houses my GitHub Pages website, showcasing a variety of projects that I‚Äôve developed or enjoyed working on. Below is an overview of each project ‚Äì including what it does, the technologies used, and a link to view it live ‚Äì as part of my portfolio.

## üõ°Ô∏è **CyberSentinel ‚Äì Cybersecurity Platform**

**Description:** *CyberSentinel* is an advanced cybersecurity platform featuring multiple interactive modules for threat intelligence, OSINT (open-source intelligence), vulnerability assessment, cryptography, and social engineering. It provides a unified interface where users can visualize cyber threats (e.g. a *Threat Intelligence Visualizer*) and experiment with tools like an OSINT lab and cryptography workbench, all within a single web application. This project offers a comprehensive demonstration of cybersecurity concepts through data visualizations and simulations.

* **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (utilizing libraries like **D3.js**, **Three.js**, and **Chart.js** for interactive visuals).
* **Live Demo:** [CyberSentinel Platform](https://jhviw.github.io/CyberSentinels/)

## üíß **ChatGPT Water Footprint ‚Äì Interactive Analysis**

**Description:** *ChatGPT‚Äôs Global Water Footprint* is an interactive ‚Äúwhitepaper‚Äù that explores the hidden environmental impact of using AI, specifically the water consumption associated with ChatGPT. This project presents data-driven insights in a visual storytelling format ‚Äì for example, illustrating that each AI prompt can indirectly consume about **20ml of water**. It includes animated charts and maps to show the worldwide water usage of AI and raises awareness of the sustainability implications in an engaging way.

* **Technologies:** HTML, CSS (custom styling), JavaScript with animation and data libraries (**GSAP**, **D3.js**, etc.).
* **Live Demo:** [ChatGPT Water Footprint](https://jhviw.github.io/chatgpt-water-footprint/research.html)

## üïµÔ∏è **OSINT & Phishing Awareness (Research Project)**

**Description:** This is a comprehensive security research project combining an OSINT investigation with a targeted phishing awareness campaign. The study involved collecting public data on company employees and then conducting a phishing test to identify vulnerabilities in social engineering defenses. The findings were used to provide personalized feedback and improve the organization‚Äôs security awareness. Presented as a multi-page report (in Dutch), it includes an overview of research questions, methodology, results, and recommendations on strengthening phishing resilience.

* **Technologies:** HTML, CSS (**Tailwind CSS** for styling).
* **Live Demo:** [OSINT & Phishing Awareness Report](https://jhviw.github.io/osint-phishing-awareness/)

## üïπÔ∏è **‚ÄúUnmasking the Cheats‚Äù ‚Äì CS2 Vulnerability Research**

**Description:** *Unmasking the Cheats: A Deep Dive into Counter-Strike 2 Vulnerabilities* is an in-depth analytical report on cheating and security flaws in the game *Counter-Strike 2*. This project examines a specific high-profile vulnerability (CVE-2021-30481) and the mechanisms behind common cheats like wallhacks. It explains how the exploits work and proposes measures to mitigate them, combining both technical research and practical insights (including reproducing the exploits and evaluating Valve‚Äôs countermeasures). The report is presented as an article with sections covering the vulnerability details, cheat implementations, survey insights, and conclusions.

* **Technologies:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 4 framework).
* **Live Demo:** [CS2 ‚ÄúUnmasking the Cheats‚Äù Article](https://jhviw.github.io/research/cve_research.html)

## üöâ **OV Vertrektijden ‚Äì Public Transport Departures**

**Description:** *OV Vertrektijden* is a web application for viewing real-time public transport departure times in the Netherlands. It allows users to select one or multiple train stations and bus stops and displays the upcoming departures for each, including any delays or cancellations, in a clear dashboard format. The interface supports searching stops, adding favorites, and toggling a dark mode for convenience. This project showcases integration with public transit APIs to provide live data on trains and buses.

* **Technologies:** HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (with Fetch API for data).
* **Live Demo:** [OV Vertrektijden](https://jhviw.github.io/OV-Vertrektijden/)

## üöè **Bushalte API ‚Äì Bus Stop Lookup**

**Description:** *Bushalte API* is a simple web-based API tool that lets users search for Dutch bus stops by name. As you type at least 3 characters of a street or place name, it finds matching bus stops and returns details like the **quay code**, street name, and city for each result. This mini-project demonstrates a client-side search through a static dataset of bus stops (XML) and displays the results in a user-friendly table. It‚Äôs a lightweight API simulator for transit stop information.

* **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla JS parsing an XML dataset).
* **Live Demo:** [Bushalte API Search](https://jhviw.github.io/bushalte-api/)

## üé® **Minecraft Color Palette & Pattern Generator**

**Description:** This project is an interactive tool for Minecraft builders to experiment with block color palettes and patterns. Users can pick different Minecraft block colors and generate pattern previews (such as checkerboard, stripes, etc.) of a chosen size. The generator produces a grid visualization showing how selected blocks would look in combination, helping players design pixel-art or floor patterns for their builds. It‚Äôs a fun utility for creative planning in Minecraft.

* **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (dynamic DOM manipulation for pattern generation).
* **Live Demo:** [Minecraft Palette Generator](https://jhviw.github.io/MinecraftSites/ColorPaletteGenerator.html)

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Hourly Rate Tracker**

**Description:** The *Hourly Rate Tracker* is a minimalist web application to track earnings in real time. You enter your hourly pay rate, start the timer, and the app will display the elapsed time alongside the calculated earnings that accumulate as the seconds tick by. It features a simple interface with a live clock and counters for time and money, allowing you to pause/reset as needed ‚Äì useful for freelancers or anyone curious about how much they‚Äôve earned in a working session.

* **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla).
* **Live Demo:** [Hourly Rate Tracker](https://jhviw.github.io/hourlyrate/)

## üó∫Ô∏è **Thessaloniki Travel Guide**

**Description:** A single-page travel guide created for a trip to Thessaloniki, Greece. This project showcases a custom-designed itinerary page, complete with sightseeing highlights, daily schedules, and travel tips, styled in a magazine-like format. The page is richly formatted with images and sections for attractions (e.g. museums, markets, historic sites) and was tailored for the dates of the trip **6‚Äì12 August**. It served as both a personal itinerary and a front-end design exercise, demonstrating responsive layout and creative use of typography.

* **Technologies:** HTML, CSS (responsive design with custom styles).
* **Live Demo:** [Thessaloniki Trip Guide](https://jhviw.github.io/random_projects/thessaloniki.html)
